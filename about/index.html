     <p>Hey, I’m Melissa. I’m a user experience designer and photographer living in Bangor, Northern Ireland.</p>
     <p>In 2013 I graduated from Interactive Multimedia Design with first class honours and began my career in the web industry. I spent two years with the amazing team at <a href="https://twitter.com/rumblelabs">Rumble Labs</a> gaining a wide range of experience, designing and building web apps, before joining the talented bunch at web design studio, <a href="https://www.eyekiller.com/">Eyekiller</a>.


     <p>2017 has led me to transition from web design to product design as I'm now working at Belfast-based SaaS company, <a href="https://www.theappbuilder.com/">TheAppBuilder</a>, striving to better the user experience of their platform. </p>

     <p>In my spare time I’ll usually be found with my camera in hand or behind the screen editing my photos with Lightroom. I’m a huge animal lover and so my <a href="{{ site.instagram }}">Instagram</a> is generally filled with shots of cute animals, including my little mutt, Matisse. </p>
     <p>My hobbies include running a few miles along Bangor’s pretty coastline, pairing good food with great wine, attending local tech/design meetups and catching up with my favourite shows. Right now these include <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/">Game of Thrones</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372162/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Orange is the New Black</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Suits.</a> </p>
