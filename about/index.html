    <h2>Designer</h2>

     <p>I graduated from Interactive Multimedia Design in 2013 with first class honours and spent almost two years with Rumble Labs before joining the great team at <a href="http://eyekiller.com">Eyekiller</a>, where I spend my weekdays designing and developing user interfaces. </p>

    <h2>Photographer</h2>

    <p>When not behind a screen, I’m often found behind a lens. I love going on adventures with my camera, taking pictures of animals, people and interesting scenes. I also take on freelance photography work, <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch</a> if you’re interested in working with me. </p>

    <h2>And More</h2>

    <p>I’m a huge animal lover and you can usually expect me to rush over and pet any dog in sight. In my spare time I like catching up with my favourite TV shows and blogs, <a href="{{ site.twitter }}">tweeting</a> about them, keeping fit by lifting weights and running, as well as spending time with the people and animals in my life. </p>

    <p>I also enjoy mingling with fellow designers and developers at local tech or design events in Belfast, or attending <a href="https://melissakeizer.exposure.co/hybrid-conf">awesome conferences</a>. I like meeting new people and receiving friendly emails, so don't be afraid to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">say hello!</a></p>
