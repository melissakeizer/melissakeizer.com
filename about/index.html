    <p>I'm a user experience designer, simply put, I design digital products and use insights about the users to make sure I design it well. In 2013 I graduated from Interactive Multimedia Design with first class honours and began my career in the tech & design industry. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.theappbuilder.com/">TheAppBuilder</a>, where we strive to improve workplace communications and culture with our internal comms platform. But hey, that's nothing you couldn't garner from scanning over my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissakeizer/">Linkedin profile</a>. </p>

    <p>What you might not know is that I'm a huge animal lover, an avid audiobook listener and I'm super competitive when it comes to <a href="https://www.wearevertigo.com/activities/inflata-park/240">Inflatapark</a>. I enjoy spending my weekends finding new places to explore and new eating places to try, or going to a local comedy club for endless laughs. I also like running along Bangor's pretty coastline and lifting weights while making weird faces. (Let's call that, "Inflatapark training.") </p>

    <p>I'll quite often be taking photos too. I love a photography session involving animals, and when my dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matisseunleashed/">Matisse</a>, and my hamster, <a href="https://www.melissakeizerphotography.com/eckles">Eckles</a>, are bored of posing for me, I'll find new <a href="https://www.melissakeizerphotography.com/creatures">creatures</a> to photograph. I also work with clients to photograph a range of things, from local events and people, to food and restaurant interiors. I especially love a shoot involving people and their pets, so do contact me if you're interested in <a href="https://www.melissakeizerphotography.com/aint-nothin-but-a-hound-dog">pet photography session</a>.</p>

    <p>More recently I've become very interested in the world of psychology, personal development,  habits and mental health. Some books that have made a positive impact on me this year include <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism">Essentialism</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30142270-happy">Happy</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep">Why We Sleep</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me">Can’t Hurt Me</a>. I love nothing more than having a great conversation about these things over a cuppa. Oh and Fleabag. Let's talk about Fleabag.</p>
