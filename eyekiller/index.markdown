**My name is Melissa Keizer and I am a motivated designer and front-end developer based in Bangor, NI. I was very excited to learn about the web design opportunity at your company and I would like to be considered for the position.**

I have over three years experience in the industry where I've had the opportunity to feed my growing interests in UI and UX design by helping to bring app ideas from the mind to screen.

For the last year and nine months I have been working at [Rumble Labs](http://rumblelabs.com), and while I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience and learned a lot, I'm ready to be presented with new challenges in an environment that offers more variety. I am confident that I could, not only expand my knowledge and learn new creative skills with your team, but bring fresh ideas of my own to the table.

You'll find a few examples of my work below and you can [check out my CV](http://melissakeizer.com/melissa-keizer-cv-2015.pdf). However I'd really like to meet with you in person to better articulate why I'm eagar to join your team.

**Thank you for your time and I hope to speak to you soon!**
