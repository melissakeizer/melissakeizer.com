I"	<p>After attending some local events with my camera where a few people asked about my freelance photography services, I thought it would be wise to have some personal business cards I can give out at future events. So, late one night last week I set about designing my cards.</p>

<p>I know Sketch isn’t exactly designed for print work, but I set up my artboards and gave it a go anyway. Keeping the design inline with my personal website, I kept the design fairly minimal and used Adelle Sans, set in my website’s primary colours.</p>

<p>I was keen to use <a href="http://www.moo.com/uk/share/#nxfrbj">Moo</a> as their square business cards with unique backs were exactly what I was after. I uploaded my design as a PDF for the front-side, along with 12 different photographs for the back of each card. This way, I could carry about a mini portfolio of my work in my purse! After completing my order, my cards arrived a few days later.</p>

<p>Upon opening the package a little blue card fell out, telling me I have cool hair, putting a smile on my face.  I then found my business cards inside a little black box.</p>

<p>I was very happy with the quality of the cards, the matte finish on their original paper was perfect. Moo served up a great user experience, from making the design and upload process on their website very easy, to providing simple delights when you receive the product.</p>

<p>So I’d definitely recommend you try them if you’re interested in having business cards made yourself. Oh and if you were to use my <a href="http://www.moo.com/uk/share/#nxfrbj">referral code</a> that would great ;)</p>
