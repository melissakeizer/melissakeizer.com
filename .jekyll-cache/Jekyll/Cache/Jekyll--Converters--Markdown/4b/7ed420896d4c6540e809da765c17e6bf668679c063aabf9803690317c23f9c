I"{<p>Today is my last day as a Rumbler.</p>

<p>After a year and nine months of working with the amazing team at <a href="http://rumblelabs.com">Rumble Labs</a>, I am moving on to pastures new.</p>

<p>I joined the team after completing my degree in Interactive Multimedia Design, starting work two days before my graduation in July 2013. Being Rumble’s first (and still only) female hire, I earned the affectionate nickname “Number One Girl in Rumble.” Thanks, <a href="http://rumblelabs.com/about/steven-hylands/">Steven!</a> ;)</p>

<p>Rumble’s open and collaborative culture was the perfect place for me to grow as a designer and developer, as it encouraged knowledge sharing, pair programming and generally just helping teammates when you can. When <a href="http://rumblelabs.com/about/mark-leetch/">Mark</a> &amp; I weren’t exchanging <a href="http://gfycat.com/SplendidSimpleHackee">Nicki Minaj gifs</a>, we’d often be found sat side-by-side, working together on a project. This helped us work out problems more efficiently, and I usually picked up a nifty development trick while I was there.</p>

<p>My education at Rumble wasn’t limited to design and code. Luckily I had <a href="http://rumblelabs.com/about/simon-hamilton/">Simon</a> there to teach me the art of <a href="https://instagram.com/p/cOrrG0i1Rq/">wine swirling</a>, and with countless matches during the annual Rumbledon Tournament, I went from terrible to mediocre at playing table tennis.</p>

<p>My friendships with the Rumble lads extend outside of the office, as we’ve made some brilliant memories during various work events, Design Department <a href="https://melissakeizer.exposure.co/designers-explorers">photography trips</a> and during the Rumble London trip last year!</p>

<p>I’m so happy to have been part of such a super team and having the opportunity to work on plenty of interesting client and internal projects, and share an office (and a Hipchat room) with such talented and hilarious people.</p>

<p>So thank you for everything Rumble! I’ll really miss working with you guys, though I know we’ll still be getting together for regular catch ups.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So, what now?</h2>

<p>I’m deighted to announce that next week I’ll be starting my new job with the awesome team at <a href="https://www.eyekiller.com/">Eyekiller</a>. I’m very excited to dive into my UX and design role and get to know my new colleagues, and hopefully make some more great friends!</p>
