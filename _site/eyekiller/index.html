          <p><strong>My name is Melissa Keizer and I am a motivated designer and front-end developer based in Bangor, NI. I was very excited to learn about the web design opportunity at your company and I would like to be considered for the position.</strong></p>

<p>I have over three years experience in the industry where I’ve had the opportunity to feed my growing interests in UI and UX design by helping to bring app ideas from the mind to screen.</p>

<p>For the last year and nine months I have been working at <a href="http://rumblelabs.com">Rumble Labs</a>, and while I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience and learned a lot, I’m ready to be presented with new challenges in an environment that offers more variety. I am confident that I could, not only expand my knowledge and learn new creative skills with your team, but bring fresh ideas of my own to the table.</p>

<p>You’ll find a few examples of my work below and you can <a href="http://melissakeizer.com/melissa-keizer-cv-2015.pdf">check out my CV</a>. However I’d really like to meet with you in person to better articulate why I’m eagar to join your team.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for your time and I hope to speak to you soon!</strong></p>

                <h3>Rumble Labs</h3>
                <p>In one of my favourite projects to-date, I had a primary role in the design and development of the Rumble Labs portfolio site. With the aim to showcase our work and content in a highly engaging way, I conducted all of the photography for the website and created very visual designs, which I later helped build using HAML, Sass and Javascript on the framework <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>.</p>

                <h3>Belfast Ruby</h3>
                <p>Taking a completely different approach from the Rumble Labs portfolio, I designed this site for local Ruby developer meetups with the focus on typography and simplicity. I built this site on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> because of its ability to keep the code clean and efficient, with the use of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and templating language <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/">Liquid</a>.</p>

                <h3>The Laboratory</h3>
                <p>This website to advertise a new co-working space was a fast-moving project which I designed and built in a few days. I enjoyed the chance to experiment with a playful design, structure and colour scheme.</p>

                <h3>Reverspective</h3>
                <p>I recently designed a website for a London-based artist whose work is quirkly, colourful and often panoramic. To showcase the work in the best light, I made use of the full-width of the screen, and kept the design clean and minimal, while still retaining personality. </p>
